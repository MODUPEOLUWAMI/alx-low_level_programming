PROJECT NAME:
0x0F. C - Function pointers

QUESTIONS:
0. What's my name
Write a function that prints a name.

1. If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you'll never get it done
Write a function that executes a function given as a parameter on each element of an array.

2. To hell with circumstances; I create opportunities
Write a function that searches for an integer.

3. A goal is not always meant to be reached, it often serves simply as something to aim at
Write a program that performs simple operations.

4. Most hackers are young because young people tend to be adaptable. As long as you remain adaptable, you can always be a good hacker
Write a program that prints the opcodes of its own main function.

ABOUT THE PROJECT:
The project is all about function pointers . Function pointers point to the code  and to the first byte of the function. they are different from variable pointers which points tothe address of variables . pointers of function points to the address of the function.
EXAMPLE ON DECLARING A FUNCTION POINTER: int [(*ptr name)(int a, int b)]

STEPS ON HOW TO GO ABOUT THIS PROJECT
1. CREATE THE DIRECTORY
2. CREATE YOUR README.md
3. CREATE YOUR HEADER FILE "function_pointers.h" , ALL PROTOTYPES MUST BE KEPT HERE
4. CREATE main.c FILE FOR EACH QUESTION AND PASTE CORRESPONDING CODES IN EACH OF THEM
5. CREATE THE FILES OF EACH QUESTION AND WRITE YOUR CODES INTO THEM
6. DONT FORGET TO INCLUDE YOUR HEADER FILE IN YOUR .c FILE .

PRECAUTIONS:
1. No more than 5 functions per file
2. The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etcâ€¦ is forbidden.
