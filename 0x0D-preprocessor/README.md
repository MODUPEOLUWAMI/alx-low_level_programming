TOPIC: C - 0x0D-preprocessor

QUESTIONS:

0. Object-like Macro
Create a header file that defines a macro named SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.

1. Pi
Create a header file that defines a macro named PI as an abbreviation for the token 3.14159265359.

2. File name
Write a program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from, followed by a new line.

You are allowed to use the standard library

3. Function-like macro
Write a function-like macro ABS(x) that computes the absolute value of a number x.

4. Sum 
Write a function-like macro SUM(x, y) that computes the sum of the numbers x and y.

PRECAUTIONS
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden

Don’t forget to push your header file

All your header files should be include guarded

STEPS
- CREATE YOUR _putchar.c file
- CREATE YOUR header file ( _.h) for each question
- CREATE YOUR main.c file and copy the codes given into it . DON'T FORGET - to linkyour header file with your main.c file.
- USE VI TO WRITE YOUR LINES OF CODES
- QUIT AND SAVE 
- USE GCC COMPLIER TO COMPILE YOUR WORK
- THE TYPE : git add .
             git commit -m " your commit nessage"
             git push

PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT
. to understand the use of preprocessors.
